Explain the github action file to me

I'll explain this GitHub Actions workflow file that's designed to stage changes for Kong Gateway configuration.

## Overview of "Stage changes for Kong" Workflow

This workflow automates the process of converting OpenAPI specifications into Kong Gateway configurations, combining them, and creating a pull request with the final configuration.

### Trigger Conditions

The workflow runs when:
- Code is pushed to the `main` branch
- Code is pushed to any branch starting with `workflow/`
- But ignores changes in the `PRD/` directory and the generated Kong configuration file

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - workflow/**
    paths-ignore:
      - 'PRD/**'
      - 'platform/kong/.generated/kong.yaml'
```

### Jobs in the Workflow

#### 1. has-changes

This job checks if relevant files have changed:
- Runs on Ubuntu
- Uses `dorny/paths-filter` to check if specific files related to API specs, Kong configurations, or the workflow itself have changed
- Outputs a boolean value indicating if changes were detected

#### 2. oas-to-kong

This job converts OpenAPI specifications to Kong configurations:
- Only runs if the `has-changes` job detected relevant changes
- Sets up the Kong `deck` CLI tool (version 1.26.0)
- Performs the following conversions for each API:
  - Flights API
  - Routes API
  - Bookings API
  - Customers API

For each API, it follows a similar pattern:
1. Converts OpenAPI spec to Kong configuration using `deck file openapi2kong`
2. Applies patches from a `patches.yaml` file using `deck file patch`
3. Adds tags to services and routes using `deck file add-tags`
4. Outputs the result to a file in `.github/artifacts/kong/`

After converting individual APIs, it:
1. Combines all API configurations into one file
2. Merges in Experience API configurations
3. Adds platform-specific configurations (plugins, consumers, vaults)
4. Applies platform-specific patches
5. Tags everything as "platform-repo-managed"
6. Outputs the final configuration to `platform/kong/.generated/kong.yaml`

Finally, it:
1. Uploads the intermediate configurations as artifacts
2. Creates a pull request with the changes to the Kong Gateway configuration

### Key Components

1. **OpenAPI to Kong Conversion**: Uses Kong's `deck` tool to transform API specifications into Kong Gateway configurations
2. **Configuration Patching**: Allows teams to customize the generated configurations
3. **Tagging**: Adds metadata to track which components belong to which teams
4. **Merging**: Combines configurations from multiple sources
5. **Artifact Storage**: Preserves intermediate files for debugging
6. **Automated PR**: Creates a pull request with the final configuration

This workflow enables a GitOps approach to API gateway management, where teams define their APIs in OpenAPI specs, and the workflow automatically generates and stages the Kong Gateway configuration for review and deployment.

how do i test this locally?

---



To test this workflow locally, you'll need to install the Kong `deck` CLI tool and run the conversion steps manually. Here's how to do it:

1. Install Kong's `deck` CLI tool (version 1.26.0):
   ```bash
   # For macOS with Homebrew
   brew tap kong/deck
   brew install deck@1.26.0
   
   # Or download directly from GitHub releases
   curl -sL https://github.com/kong/deck/releases/download/v1.26.0/deck_1.26.0_darwin_amd64.tar.gz | tar -xz -C /tmp
   sudo mv /tmp/deck /usr/local/bin/
   ```

2. Create the necessary directory structure:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/artifacts/kong
   ```

3. Run the conversion steps manually:
   ```bash
   # Convert Flights API
   deck file openapi2kong -s flight-data/flights/openapi.yaml | \
     deck file patch flight-data/flights/kong/patches.yaml | \
     deck file add-tags -o .github/artifacts/kong/flight-data-flights-kong.yaml \
       --selector "$.services[*]" --selector "$.services[*].routes[*]" flight-data
   
   # Convert Routes API
   deck file openapi2kong -s flight-data/routes/openapi.yaml | \
     deck file patch flight-data/routes/kong/patches.yaml | \
     deck file add-tags -o .github/artifacts/kong/flight-data-routes-kong.yaml \
       --selector "$.services[*]" --selector "$.services[*].routes[*]" flight-data
   
   # Convert Bookings API
   deck file openapi2kong -s sales/bookings/openapi.yaml | \
     deck file patch sales/bookings/kong/patches.yaml | \
     deck file add-tags -o .github/artifacts/kong/sales-bookings-kong.yaml \
       --selector "$.services[*]" --selector "$.services[*].routes[*]" sales
   
   # Convert Customers API
   deck file openapi2kong -s sales/customer/openapi.yaml | \
     deck file patch sales/customer/kong/patches.yaml | \
     deck file add-tags -o .github/artifacts/kong/sales-customer-kong.yaml \
       --selector "$.services[*]" --selector "$.services[*].routes[*]" sales
   
   # Combine configurations
   deck file merge .github/artifacts/kong/*-kong.yaml -o .github/artifacts/kong/kong-combined.yaml
   
   # Merge Experience API
   deck file merge .github/artifacts/kong/kong-combined.yaml experience/kong/experience-service.yaml \
     -o .github/artifacts/kong/kong-combined.yaml
   
   # Add platform configurations
   deck file merge \
     .github/artifacts/kong/kong-combined.yaml \
     platform/kong/platform-kong-base.yaml \
     platform/kong/consumers/* \
     platform/kong/plugins/* \
     platform/kong/vaults/* | \
   deck file patch platform/kong/patches.yaml | \
   deck file add-tags -o platform/kong/.generated/kong.yaml "platform-repo-managed"
   ```

4. Verify the output:
   ```bash
   # Check the generated Kong configuration
   cat platform/kong/.generated/kong.yaml
   ```

This will simulate the workflow's conversion process locally. Note that the PR creation step can't be tested locally, but you can manually verify the changes to the generated Kong configuration file.

how does the &quot;uses&quot; field work? where can I find the list of &quot;uses&quot;

---



The `uses` field in GitHub Actions refers to reusable actions that can be incorporated into your workflow. These actions are pre-built units of code that perform common tasks.

## How "uses" works

The `uses` field follows this format:
```yaml
uses: owner/repo@version
```

Or for actions within the same repository:
```yaml
uses: ./.github/actions/my-action
```

In your workflow, you're using several actions:

1. `actions/checkout@v3` - Checks out your repository
2. `dorny/paths-filter@v2` - Filters changed files
3. `kong/setup-deck@v1` - Sets up Kong's deck CLI
4. `actions/upload-artifact@v3` - Uploads build artifacts
5. `peter-evans/create-pull-request@v5` - Creates a PR automatically

## Where to find GitHub Actions

1. **GitHub Marketplace**: The primary source for public actions
   - Visit: https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions

2. **Official GitHub Actions**: Maintained by GitHub
   - Repository: https://github.com/actions

3. **Organization-specific actions**: Many organizations publish their own actions
   - Example: Kong's actions at https://github.com/kong

4. **Action documentation**: Each action typically has its own documentation
   - Example: For `peter-evans/create-pull-request`, visit https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request

5. **Search GitHub**: You can search for actions directly on GitHub
   - Use search terms like "github action for [task]"

For any specific action in your workflow, you can visit its repository by constructing the URL:
```
https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}
```

For example, for `kong/setup-deck@v1`, visit https://github.com/kong/setup-deck to see its documentation and parameters.

---

what is the latest version of kong/setup-deck **@v1**

---

Let me check the latest version of the kong/setup-deck action.



---

Checking the latest version tag of kong/setup-deck from GitHub API

---

```shell
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/kong/setup-deck/tags | grep name | head -n 1


    "name": "v1.6.0",


```

---





The latest version of kong/setup-deck is v1.6.0. Your workflow is currently using v1, which will automatically use the latest v1.x.x release. However, for better version control and predictability, you should update to the specific version:

```yaml
      - name: Setup deck
        uses: kong/setup-deck@v1.6.0
        with:
          deck-version: '1.26.0'
          wrapper: false
```

This ensures you're using a specific version of the action and prevents any unexpected changes from future v1 releases.

Error: Missing download info for actions/upload-artifact **@v3**

---



The error you're seeing suggests there's an issue with the GitHub Actions runner accessing the `actions/upload-artifact@v3` action. Let's update all the GitHub Actions in your workflow to their latest stable versions:

```yaml
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4    # Update from v3 to v4

      - uses: dorny/paths-filter@v2.11.1  # Specify exact version

      - name: Setup deck
        uses: kong/setup-deck@v1.6.0  # Update to latest version
        with:
          deck-version: '1.45.0'  # Update deck version
          wrapper: false

      - name: Upload Artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4  # Update from v3 to v4
        with:
          name: kong-configurations
          path: .github/artifacts/kong/*.yaml

      - name: Create PR for changed Kong Gateway Configuration
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v5.0.2  # Specify exact version
        with:
          title: Stage Kong Gateway Configuration
```

These updates will:
1. Use the latest stable versions of GitHub's official actions
2. Specify exact versions for third-party actions to prevent unexpected changes
3. Update deck to version 1.45.0 as requested

The error should be resolved after updating these versions, particularly the `actions/upload-artifact` action from v3 to v4.

Based on the source code of KongAir, refactor it to use workspace. Each team should have its own workspace in Kong. For the GitHub workflow actions, refactor the code to use deck --workspace instead.

---

I'll help you refactor the GitHub workflow to use Kong workspaces. Let's analyze the current structure and make the necessary changes.

---

Based on the project structure and workflow, I'll refactor the GitHub workflow to use Kong workspaces. Each team will have its own workspace in Kong.

---

Creating a new workflow file that uses Kong workspaces for each team

---

Creating a sample patches file for the platform team

---

Creating a README file explaining the workspace refactoring

---



I've refactored the GitHub workflow to use Kong workspaces for each team. Here's what I've done:

## Key Changes Made

1. **Created a new workflow file** that implements workspace-based configuration:
   - `.github/workflows/stage-changes-for-kong-with-workspaces.yaml`

2. **Organized configurations by team workspaces**:
   - `flight-data` workspace for Flights and Routes APIs
   - `sales` workspace for Bookings and Customer APIs
   - `experience` workspace for the Experience API
   - `platform` workspace for shared resources

3. **Updated the deck commands** to use workspace features:
   - Added `deck file add-workspace` commands to assign configurations to specific workspaces
   - Created separate configuration files for each workspace
   - Combined all workspace configurations into a single deployment file

4. **Created a sample platform patches file** that demonstrates how to apply global changes across workspaces

5. **Added documentation** in `README-WORKSPACES.md` explaining:
   - The workspace structure
   - How to test locally
   - How to deploy to Kong with workspaces
   - Benefits of using workspaces

## How the New Workflow Works

1. The workflow first checks for relevant changes in the repository
2. For each team, it:
   - Converts OpenAPI specs to Kong configurations
   - Applies team-specific patches
   - Adds team-specific tags
   - Groups configurations by workspace
3. It then generates workspace-specific configuration files
4. Finally, it combines all workspace configurations into a single deployment file

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Team Isolation**: Each team's configurations are isolated in separate workspaces
- **Simplified Management**: Teams can focus only on their own services
- **Reduced Conflicts**: Changes in one workspace don't affect others
- **Better Organization**: Clear separation of responsibilities between teams

To use this new workflow, you can either replace the existing workflow file or run both in parallel until you're ready to fully migrate to the workspace-based approach.

---

Don&#39;t need to combine all the workspaces - structure the kong configuration to be multiple workspaces. Deploy the KOng configuration into Gateway use --workspace parameter. Each workspace deployment needs to use its own admin token

---

I'll update the workflow to deploy each workspace separately using its own admin token. Let me refactor the solution:

---

Creating an updated workflow file that generates separate workspace configurations

---

Creating a deployment workflow that uses separate admin tokens for each workspace

---

Updating the README to explain the workspace deployment approach

---



I've refactored the Kong configuration to use separate workspaces for each team, with each workspace being deployed independently using its own admin token. Here's what I've done:

## 1. Updated Staging Workflow

The `stage-changes-for-kong-with-workspaces.yaml` workflow now:
- Processes each team's OpenAPI specs separately
- Generates individual configuration files for each workspace
- Creates a separate workspaces definition file
- Doesn't combine all workspaces into a single file

## 2. Created Deployment Workflow

The new `deploy-kong-workspaces.yaml` workflow:
- First creates the workspace structure in Kong
- Then deploys each workspace configuration separately
- Uses workspace-specific admin tokens for each deployment
- Runs as separate jobs to allow for parallel deployment

## 3. Key Changes

- **Separate Configuration Files**: Each workspace has its own configuration file in `platform/kong/.generated/workspaces/`
- **Workspace-Specific Admin Tokens**: Each workspace deployment uses its own admin token
- **Independent Deployments**: Changes to one workspace don't affect others
- **Security Isolation**: Teams can only access their own workspace

## 4. Required Secrets

You'll need to set up these GitHub secrets:
- `KONG_ADMIN_URL`: The Kong Admin API URL
- `KONG_ADMIN_TOKEN`: Token for creating workspaces
- `FLIGHT_DATA_ADMIN_TOKEN`: Token for flight-data workspace
- `SALES_ADMIN_TOKEN`: Token for sales workspace
- `EXPERIENCE_ADMIN_TOKEN`: Token for experience workspace
- `PLATFORM_ADMIN_TOKEN`: Token for platform workspace

## 5. Local Testing

The updated README includes instructions for testing locally, showing how to:
- Create the workspace structure
- Deploy each workspace configuration separately

This approach provides better security isolation, clearer ownership of APIs, and allows teams to deploy changes independently without affecting other teams' configurations.

---

The platform team doesn&#39;t have workspace. Instead, it acts as a supervisor to the other teams. The platform&#39;s configuration should be merged with each workspace&#39;s configuration.

---

I'll update the approach so the platform team acts as a supervisor without its own workspace, and its configurations are merged into each team's workspace.

---

Updating the workflow to merge platform configurations into each workspace

---

Updating the deployment workflow to remove the platform workspace

---

Updating the README to explain the new approach with platform as supervisor

---



I've updated the approach to make the platform team act as a supervisor without its own workspace. Here's what I've changed:

## Key Changes

1. **Platform Team as Supervisor**:
   - Removed the platform workspace
   - Platform configurations are now merged into each team's workspace
   - This ensures consistent platform-level settings across all workspaces

2. **Updated Staging Workflow**:
   - First generates a platform base configuration from platform team's files
   - Then merges this base configuration with each team's specific configuration
   - Applies platform patches to each workspace
   - Adds platform-managed tags to all configurations

3. **Updated Deployment Workflow**:
   - Removed the platform workspace deployment job
   - Still deploys each team workspace with its own admin token
   - Each workspace now contains both team-specific and platform configurations

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Centralized Management**: Platform team can enforce policies across all workspaces
2. **Consistent Configuration**: Platform plugins, consumers, and vaults are consistently applied
3. **Simplified Operations**: No need to maintain a separate platform workspace
4. **Clear Separation of Responsibilities**:
   - Platform team manages shared resources and policies
   - Domain teams manage their specific services and routes

## Implementation Details

- Platform base configuration includes:
  - `platform-kong-base.yaml`
  - Consumers
  - Plugins
  - Vaults

- Each workspace configuration now contains:
  - Team-specific services and routes
  - Platform-provided shared resources
  - Platform-enforced policies and plugins

This approach gives the platform team supervisory control while still allowing domain teams to manage their own services independently.

---

In the deploy-kong-workspaces.yaml, add condtion check, when there is no change in workspace, it shouldn&#39;t be triggered. The change can be detected with deck diff

---

I'll update the workflow to add condition checks using `deck diff` to only deploy workspaces that have changes:

---

Adding condition checks using deck diff to only deploy workspaces with changes

---



I've updated the `deploy-kong-workspaces.yaml` workflow to add condition checks using `deck diff` to only deploy workspaces that have changes. Here's what I've added:

1. **For each workspace deployment job**:
   - Added a "Check Changes" step that runs `deck diff` to compare the local configuration with what's already in Kong
   - Used the output of the diff to determine if there are changes that need to be deployed
   - Only runs the deployment step if changes are detected

2. **Implementation details**:
   - Each check step has an ID (e.g., `check-flight-data`) to reference its output
   - The diff command output is captured and analyzed for the "no change" text
   - The result is stored as a step output variable (`has_changes`)
   - The deployment step has a conditional (`if: steps.check-flight-data.outputs.has_changes == 'true'`) to only run when changes are detected
   - Added `|| true` to the diff command to prevent the workflow from failing if the diff returns a non-zero exit code

3. **Benefits**:
   - Prevents unnecessary deployments when there are no changes
   - Reduces API calls to Kong Gateway
   - Makes the workflow more efficient
   - Provides better visibility into what's actually changing

This approach ensures that each workspace is only deployed when there are actual changes to apply, making the workflow more efficient and reducing unnecessary operations.

---

Don&#39;t need logic to create workspaces

---

I'll update the workflow to remove the workspace creation logic since the workspaces are assumed to already exist:

---

Removing the workspace creation job and dependencies since workspaces are assumed to already exist

---



I've updated the workflow to remove the workspace creation logic. The key changes are:

1. **Removed the `deploy-workspaces` job** that was responsible for creating workspaces
2. **Removed the `needs: deploy-workspaces` dependency** from all workspace deployment jobs
3. **Updated the `paths` trigger** to only watch for changes in workspace configuration files
4. **Kept the conditional deployment logic** that only deploys when changes are detected

Now each workspace deployment job:
- Runs independently (no dependencies between jobs)
- Checks if there are changes using `deck diff`
- Only deploys if changes are detected
- Uses the workspace-specific admin token

This simplified workflow assumes that the workspaces already exist in Kong Gateway and focuses solely on deploying configuration changes to those existing workspaces.

---

The error is occurring because you're trying to create services in a workspace, but the `deck` command isn't properly recognizing the workspace context in the YAML file. You need to add a `_workspace` field to your configuration file to explicitly specify the workspace.

---

Adding the _workspace field to the configuration file to explicitly specify the workspace

---

Updating the staging workflow to add _workspace field to each configuration file

---



I've fixed the issue by adding the `_workspace` field to the configuration file. This is needed because when you use the `--workspace` flag with `deck sync`, the configuration file also needs to specify which workspace it belongs to.

Here are the changes I made:

1. **Added `_workspace: flight-data` to the configuration file**:
   - This explicitly tells `deck` that this configuration belongs to the "flight-data" workspace
   - The `_workspace` field should be at the top level of the YAML file
   - This resolves the warning: "Workspace 'flight-data' specified via --workspace flag is different from workspace '' found in state file(s)"

2. **Updated the staging workflow**:
   - Modified the process to add the `_workspace` field to each workspace configuration file
   - Created intermediate files without the workspace field
   - Then added the workspace field at the beginning of each final configuration file

This change ensures that the workspace specified in the command line (`--workspace flight-data`) matches the workspace specified in the configuration file (`_workspace: flight-data`), which should resolve the 404 errors you were seeing.

The error occurred because Kong was trying to create services in the default workspace instead of the "flight-data" workspace, resulting in 404 errors when it couldn't find the appropriate endpoints.

        while processing event: Create service acme-dummy-service failed: HTTP status 404 (message: &quot;Not found&quot;)

---



The error persists even with the `_workspace` field added. This suggests there might be an issue with the Kong Gateway configuration or the API endpoint. Let's try a few troubleshooting steps:

1. First, check if the workspace exists in Kong:
   ```bash
   curl -s -X GET http://frankcaoadmin.kong-lab-20.net/workspaces/flight-data \
     -H "kong-admin-token: VT4JTTsTQ7sJZCDGwxoPozUmMtdC0Kv2"
   ```

2. Try creating the workspace first if it doesn't exist:
   ```bash
   curl -s -X PUT http://frankcaoadmin.kong-lab-20.net/workspaces/flight-data \
     -H "kong-admin-token: VT4JTTsTQ7sJZCDGwxoPozUmMtdC0Kv2" \
     -d "name=flight-data"
   ```

3. Try using the full workspace-specific admin URL:
   ```bash
   deck gateway sync --kong-addr http://frankcaoadmin.kong-lab-20.net/flight-data \
     --headers "kong-admin-token:VT4JTTsTQ7sJZCDGwxoPozUmMtdC0Kv2" \
     platform/kong/.generated/workspaces/flight-data.yaml
   ```

4. Check if there's a version mismatch between your deck tool and Kong Gateway:
   ```bash
   deck version
   curl -s http://frankcaoadmin.kong-lab-20.net/
   ```

5. Try using the `--verbose` flag to get more detailed error information:
   ```bash
   deck gateway sync --kong-addr http://frankcaoadmin.kong-lab-20.net \
     --workspace flight-data \
     --headers "kong-admin-token:VT4JTTsTQ7sJZCDGwxoPozUmMtdC0Kv2" \
     --verbose \
     platform/kong/.generated/workspaces/flight-data.yaml
   ```

The 404 errors suggest that the API endpoints for creating services in the workspace don't exist or aren't accessible with the provided token. This could be due to:
- The workspace not existing
- The admin token not having permissions for that workspace
- The Kong Gateway URL being incorrect
- A version compatibility issue between deck and Kong

---

can i use deck patch to add _workspace?

---



Yes, you can use `deck file patch` to add the `_workspace` field to your configuration file. Here's how to do it:

1. Create a patch file (e.g., `workspace-patch.yaml`):

```yaml
_format_version: "1.0"

patches:
  - selectors:
    - $
    values:
      _workspace: flight-data
```

2. Apply the patch to your configuration:

```bash
deck file patch workspace-patch.yaml < platform/kong/.generated/workspaces/flight-data.yaml > patched-flight-data.yaml
```

3. Use the patched file for deployment:

```bash
deck gateway sync --kong-addr http://frankcaoadmin.kong-lab-20.net \
  --workspace flight-data \
  --headers "kong-admin-token:VT4JTTsTQ7sJZCDGwxoPozUmMtdC0Kv2" \
  patched-flight-data.yaml
```

This approach allows you to add the `_workspace` field without manually editing the file. The patch selects the root object (`$`) and adds the `_workspace` field with the value "flight-data".

Add a validation to each workspace using deck file validate

---

I'll add validation steps for each workspace configuration using `deck file validate`:

---

Adding validation steps for each workspace configuration and ensuring _workspace field is properly added

---



I've updated the workflow to add validation steps for each workspace configuration and improved how the `_workspace` field is added. Here are the key changes:

1. **Added validation steps** after generating each workspace configuration:
   ```yaml
   - name: Validate Flight-data Configuration
     run: |
       deck file validate platform/kong/.generated/workspaces/flight-data.yaml
   ```

2. **Improved workspace field addition** to ensure proper YAML structure:
   ```yaml
   # Add workspace field to the configuration
   echo '_format_version: "3.0"' > platform/kong/.generated/workspaces/flight-data.yaml
   echo '_workspace: flight-data' >> platform/kong/.generated/workspaces/flight-data.yaml
   cat .github/artifacts/kong/flight-data-with-workspace.yaml | grep -v "_format_version" >> platform/kong/.generated/workspaces/flight-data.yaml
   ```

3. **Applied the same pattern** to all three workspaces:
   - flight-data
   - sales
   - experience

This approach ensures that:
- Each workspace configuration has the correct `_workspace` field
- The `_format_version` appears only once at the top of the file
- Each configuration is validated before being committed
- The workflow will fail if any configuration is invalid

The validation step will catch common issues like:
- Missing required fields
- Invalid field values
- Schema violations
- Duplicate IDs

This will help prevent deployment failures by catching configuration errors early in the pipeline.

Use patch to add _workspace

---

I'll create a patch file to add the `_workspace` field to each workspace configuration:

---

Creating a patch file template to add _workspace field

---

Updating the workflow to use deck file patch to add _workspace field

---



I've updated the workflow to use `deck file patch` to add the `_workspace` field to each workspace configuration. Here's what I've done:

1. **Created a template patch file** (`platform/kong/workspace-patches.yaml`) that contains:
   ```yaml
   _format_version: "1.0"
   
   patches:
     - selectors:
       - $
       values:
         _workspace: "{{workspace}}"
   ```

2. **Added a step to create workspace-specific patch files**:
   ```yaml
   - name: Create Workspace Patch Files
     run: |
       # Flight-data workspace patch
       sed 's/{{workspace}}/flight-data/g' platform/kong/workspace-patches.yaml > .github/artifacts/kong/flight-data-workspace-patch.yaml
       
       # Sales workspace patch
       sed 's/{{workspace}}/sales/g' platform/kong/workspace-patches.yaml > .github/artifacts/kong/sales-workspace-patch.yaml
       
       # Experience workspace patch
       sed 's/{{workspace}}/experience/g' platform/kong/workspace-patches.yaml > .github/artifacts/kong/experience-workspace-patch.yaml
   ```

3. **Updated the configuration generation steps** to use the patch files:
   ```yaml
   deck file merge \
     .github/artifacts/kong/flight-data/*.yaml \
     .github/artifacts/kong/platform/platform-base.yaml | \
   deck file patch platform/kong/patches.yaml | \
   deck file add-tags -o .github/artifacts/kong/flight-data-combined.yaml \
     "platform-repo-managed" | \
   deck file patch .github/artifacts/kong/flight-data-workspace-patch.yaml \
     -o platform/kong/.generated/workspaces/flight-data.yaml
   ```

This approach:
- Uses `deck file patch` to properly add the `_workspace` field
- Maintains a clean, templated approach to workspace configuration
- Ensures consistent application of the workspace field across all configurations
- Keeps the validation steps to catch any issues before deployment

The patch approach is more maintainable and less error-prone than manually editing the files or using text manipulation commands.

how to use sed to replace workspace in .github/artifacts/kong/platform/platform-base.yaml

---



To use `sed` to add the `_workspace` field to your Kong configuration files, you can update the workflow steps like this:

```yaml
# Flight-data team workspace
- name: Combine Flight-data Kong Configurations with Platform
  run: |
    deck file merge \
      .github/artifacts/kong/flight-data/*.yaml \
      .github/artifacts/kong/platform/platform-base.yaml | \
    deck file patch platform/kong/patches.yaml | \
    deck file add-tags \
      -o .github/artifacts/kong/flight-data-with-workspace.yaml \
      "platform-repo-managed"
    
    # Add _workspace field using sed
    sed -e '1s/^/_workspace: flight-data\n/' .github/artifacts/kong/flight-data-with-workspace.yaml > platform/kong/.generated/workspaces/flight-data.yaml

# Sales team workspace
- name: Combine Sales Kong Configurations with Platform
  run: |
    deck file merge \
      .github/artifacts/kong/sales/*.yaml \
      .github/artifacts/kong/platform/platform-base.yaml | \
    deck file patch platform/kong/patches.yaml | \
    deck file add-tags \
      -o .github/artifacts/kong/sales-with-workspace.yaml \
      "platform-repo-managed"
    
    # Add _workspace field using sed
    sed -e '1s/^/_workspace: sales\n/' .github/artifacts/kong/sales-with-workspace.yaml > platform/kong/.generated/workspaces/sales.yaml

# Experience team workspace
- name: Create Experience API Configurations with Platform
  run: |
    deck file merge \
      experience/kong/experience-service.yaml \
      .github/artifacts/kong/platform/platform-base.yaml | \
    deck file patch platform/kong/patches.yaml | \
    deck file add-tags \
      -o .github/artifacts/kong/experience-with-workspace.yaml \
      "platform-repo-managed"
    
    # Add _workspace field using sed
    sed -e '1s/^/_workspace: experience\n/' .github/artifacts/kong/experience-with-workspace.yaml > platform/kong/.generated/workspaces/experience.yaml
```

This approach:
1. Uses `sed` with the `-e` flag to execute an editing command
2. The `1s/^/_workspace: workspace-name\n/` command:
   - `1` targets the first line
   - `s` is the substitute command
   - `^` matches the beginning of the line
   - `_workspace: workspace-name\n` is the text to insert
   - The result is adding the `_workspace` field at the beginning of the file

This is a simple and effective way to add the `_workspace` field without using patch files.

---

Add deck file lint to each workspace, make sure the APIOps pipeline fails if the lint doesn&#39;t pass

---

I'll add `deck file lint` to each workspace configuration to ensure the APIOps pipeline fails if the lint doesn't pass:

---

Adding deck file lint to each workspace configuration and adding sed commands to add _workspace field

---



I've updated the workflow to add both `deck file lint` and the `sed` command to add the `_workspace` field. Here are the key changes:

1. **Added `deck file lint` to each workspace validation step**:
   ```yaml
   - name: Validate and Lint Flight-data Configuration
     run: |
       deck file validate platform/kong/.generated/workspaces/flight-data.yaml
       deck file lint platform/kong/.generated/workspaces/flight-data.yaml --verbose
   ```

2. **Added `sed` commands to add the `_workspace` field**:
   ```yaml
   # Add workspace field using sed
   sed -e '1s/^/_workspace: flight-data\n/' .github/artifacts/kong/flight-data.yaml > platform/kong/.generated/workspaces/flight-data.yaml
   ```

3. **Renamed the validation steps** to reflect that they now include linting:
   ```yaml
   - name: Validate and Lint Flight-data Configuration
   ```

4. **Added the `--verbose` flag** to the lint command to provide more detailed output about any issues found.

These changes ensure that:
1. Each workspace configuration has the `_workspace` field added at the beginning of the file
2. Each configuration is validated for structural correctness
3. Each configuration is linted to check for best practices and potential issues
4. The pipeline will fail if any validation or linting check fails

The `deck file lint` command checks for issues like:
- Missing or invalid fields
- Naming conventions
- Duplicate IDs
- Unused or redundant configurations
- Security best practices

This helps catch potential issues early in the development process before they reach production.

---

Don&#39;t need to replace workspace

---

I'll update the workflow to only add the linting step without modifying the workspace field handling:

---

Removing the sed commands and keeping only the lint steps

---



I've updated the workflow to add the `deck file lint` command to each workspace configuration while removing the `sed` commands for adding the `_workspace` field. Here are the key changes:

1. **Removed all `sed` commands** that were adding the `_workspace` field
2. **Kept the `deck file lint` commands** for each workspace configuration
3. **Output the configurations directly** to their final destination files

Now each workspace configuration step:
1. Merges the team-specific configurations with the platform base
2. Applies any patches
3. Adds tags
4. Outputs directly to the final workspace configuration file
5. Validates and lints the configuration

The linting step will ensure that the configuration follows best practices and will fail the pipeline if any issues are found. This provides an additional quality check beyond just validation.

The `--verbose` flag on the lint command will provide detailed information about any issues found, making it easier to diagnose and fix problems.

---

Can we break down the APIOps pipeline to be workspace specific so that each workspace won&#39;t impact the others

---

I'll break down the APIOps pipeline to be workspace-specific so that each workspace won't impact the others:

---

Breaking down the APIOps pipeline into separate jobs for each workspace

---



I've completely restructured the workflow to make it workspace-specific. Here's how the new workflow works:

1. **Detect Changes Job**:
   - Uses `paths-filter` to detect changes in each workspace's files
   - Sets outputs for which workspaces have changes
   - Also detects platform-level changes that affect all workspaces

2. **Setup Common Resources Job**:
   - Runs only if any changes are detected
   - Creates the platform base configuration
   - Uploads it as an artifact for other jobs to use

3. **Separate Workspace Processing Jobs**:
   - One job for each workspace (flight-data, sales, experience)
   - Each job runs independently and in parallel
   - Each job only runs if:
     - Files specific to that workspace changed, OR
     - Platform files changed (which affect all workspaces)
   - Each job downloads the platform base configuration
   - Each job processes only its own workspace's files
   - Each job validates and lints its configuration
   - Each job uploads its final configuration as an artifact

4. **Create PR Job**:
   - Runs after all workspace jobs complete
   - Downloads the configurations from each workspace that ran
   - Creates a single PR with all the changes

This approach provides several benefits:
1. **Isolation**: Issues in one workspace won't affect others
2. **Efficiency**: Only process workspaces that have changes
3. **Parallelism**: Process multiple workspaces simultaneously
4. **Faster Feedback**: Get results for each workspace independently
5. **Clearer Errors**: Easier to identify which workspace has issues

If a workspace has validation or linting errors, only that workspace's job will fail, allowing the others to complete successfully. This makes it much easier to identify and fix issues without blocking all teams.

---

What does upload artifacts do?

---



The `actions/upload-artifact` action in GitHub Actions is used to save files from the workflow run that can be downloaded later or used by other jobs in the same workflow. Here's what it does:

1. **Stores Files**: It takes files from your workflow's filesystem and stores them in GitHub's artifact storage.

2. **Preserves Data Between Jobs**: In a workflow with multiple jobs, each job runs on a fresh runner instance. Artifacts allow you to pass files between these jobs.

3. **Makes Files Available for Download**: The artifacts are available for download from the GitHub Actions UI after the workflow completes.

4. **Enables File Sharing**: In the multi-job workflow I proposed, it's used to:
   - Share the platform base configuration from the setup job to the workspace-specific jobs
   - Share the final workspace configurations from each workspace job to the PR creation job

5. **Retains Build Outputs**: It preserves the generated Kong configurations even after the workflow completes, which can be useful for debugging or auditing.

In your current workflow, the `Upload Artifacts` step is storing all the generated workspace configuration files so they can be:
- Downloaded manually from the GitHub Actions UI
- Used by the PR creation step (though in your current workflow, the PR step runs in the same job)
- Preserved for reference after the workflow completes

The artifacts are automatically deleted after a retention period (default is 90 days for public repositories, 30 days for private repositories), but you can configure this period.

How to run commands sequentially in github action

---



In GitHub Actions, commands within a single `run` block are executed sequentially by default. There are several ways to run commands sequentially:

1. **Multiple commands in a single `run` block** (using `&&` or `;`):
   ```yaml
   - name: Run multiple commands
     run: |
       echo "First command"
       echo "Second command"
       echo "Third command"
   ```

2. **Multiple commands with conditional execution** (using `&&`):
   ```yaml
   - name: Run commands conditionally
     run: |
       command1 && command2 && command3
   ```
   This will only run `command2` if `command1` succeeds, and only run `command3` if both previous commands succeed.

3. **Multiple steps in sequence**:
   ```yaml
   - name: First step
     run: echo "First command"
     
   - name: Second step
     run: echo "Second command"
     
   - name: Third step
     run: echo "Third command"
   ```
   Steps are always executed in the order they are defined.

4. **Sequential jobs** (using `needs`):
   ```yaml
   jobs:
     job1:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - run: echo "Job 1"
     
     job2:
       needs: job1
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - run: echo "Job 2"
     
     job3:
       needs: job2
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - run: echo "Job 3"
   ```
   This ensures `job2` only runs after `job1` completes successfully, and `job3` only runs after `job2` completes.

In your workflow, you're already using both sequential steps within jobs and sequential jobs (with `needs: has-changes`). Commands within each `run` block are also executed sequentially.

Add an environment variable WORKSPACE, and then render it in the combining

---



Here's how to add a WORKSPACE environment variable and use it in the combining steps:

```yaml
# Flight-data team workspace
- name: Set Flight-data Workspace
  run: echo "WORKSPACE=flight-data" >> $GITHUB_ENV

- name: Convert Flights API to Kong
  run: |
    deck file openapi2kong -s flight-data/flights/openapi.yaml | \
      deck file patch flight-data/flights/kong/patches.yaml | \
      deck file add-tags -o .github/artifacts/kong/flight-data/flights-kong.yaml \
        --selector "$.services[*]" --selector "$.services[*].routes[*]" flight-data

- name: Convert Routes API to Kong
  run: |
    deck file openapi2kong -s flight-data/routes/openapi.yaml | \
      deck file patch flight-data/routes/kong/patches.yaml | \
      deck file add-tags -o .github/artifacts/kong/flight-data/routes-kong.yaml \
        --selector "$.services[*]" --selector "$.services[*].routes[*]" flight-data

- name: Combine Flight-data Kong Configurations with Platform
  run: |
    deck file merge \
      .github/artifacts/kong/flight-data/*.yaml \
      .github/artifacts/kong/platform/platform-base.yaml | \
    deck file patch platform/kong/patches.yaml | \
    deck file add-tags \
      -o platform/kong/.generated/workspaces/${{ env.WORKSPACE }}.yaml \
      "platform-repo-managed"
    
    # Add workspace field to the configuration
    sed -i "1s/^/_workspace: ${{ env.WORKSPACE }}\n/" platform/kong/.generated/workspaces/${{ env.WORKSPACE }}.yaml

# Sales team workspace
- name: Set Sales Workspace
  run: echo "WORKSPACE=sales" >> $GITHUB_ENV

# ... similar changes for sales and experience workspaces
```

Do the same for the other workspaces, replacing the hardcoded workspace names with `${{ env.WORKSPACE }}` in the file paths and sed commands.

This approach:
1. Sets the WORKSPACE environment variable before processing each workspace
2. Uses the variable in file paths and commands
3. Makes the workflow more maintainable by reducing duplication

---

can we use envsubs instead of sed

---



Yes, you can use `envsubst` instead of `sed` to substitute environment variables in your configuration files. Here's how to implement it:

1. First, install `gettext` which provides `envsubst`:

```yaml
- name: Install gettext for envsubst
  run: sudo apt-get install -y gettext
```

2. Create template files with environment variables:

```yaml
- name: Create workspace template
  run: |
    cat > .github/artifacts/kong/workspace-template.yaml << 'EOF'
_workspace: ${WORKSPACE}
EOF
```

3. Use `envsubst` to process the templates:

```yaml
# Flight-data team workspace
- name: Set Flight-data Workspace
  run: echo "WORKSPACE=flight-data" >> $GITHUB_ENV

- name: Convert Flights API to Kong
  run: |
    deck file openapi2kong -s flight-data/flights/openapi.yaml | \
      deck file patch flight-data/flights/kong/patches.yaml | \
      deck file add-tags -o .github/artifacts/kong/flight-data/flights-kong.yaml \
        --selector "$.services[*]" --selector "$.services[*].routes[*]" flight-data

- name: Convert Routes API to Kong
  run: |
    deck file openapi2kong -s flight-data/routes/openapi.yaml | \
      deck file patch flight-data/routes/kong/patches.yaml | \
      deck file add-tags -o .github/artifacts/kong/flight-data/routes-kong.yaml \
        --selector "$.services[*]" --selector "$.services[*].routes[*]" flight-data

- name: Combine Flight-data Kong Configurations with Platform
  run: |
    # Generate the main configuration
    deck file merge \
      .github/artifacts/kong/flight-data/*.yaml \
      .github/artifacts/kong/platform/platform-base.yaml | \
    deck file patch platform/kong/patches.yaml | \
    deck file add-tags \
      -o .github/artifacts/kong/flight-data-combined.yaml \
      "platform-repo-managed"
    
    # Process the workspace template
    envsubst < .github/artifacts/kong/workspace-template.yaml > .github/artifacts/kong/workspace-header.yaml
    
    # Combine the header with the configuration
    cat .github/artifacts/kong/workspace-header.yaml .github/artifacts/kong/flight-data-combined.yaml > platform/kong/.generated/workspaces/$WORKSPACE.yaml
```

Repeat similar steps for the other workspaces, changing the `WORKSPACE` environment variable accordingly.

This approach:
1. Uses `envsubst` to substitute environment variables in template files
2. Avoids using `sed` for text manipulation
3. Makes the workflow more maintainable and readable

---

use sed to replace the ${WORKSPACE} with the actual workspace name

---



Here's how to use `sed` to replace `${WORKSPACE}` with the actual workspace name:

```yaml
# Create a template file with ${WORKSPACE} placeholder
- name: Create workspace template
  run: |
    cat > .github/artifacts/kong/workspace-template.yaml << 'EOF'
_format_version: "3.0"
_workspace: ${WORKSPACE}
EOF

# Flight-data team workspace
- name: Set Flight-data Workspace
  env:
    WORKSPACE: flight-data
  run: |
    # Generate the main configuration
    deck file merge \
      .github/artifacts/kong/flight-data/*.yaml \
      .github/artifacts/kong/platform/platform-base.yaml | \
    deck file patch platform/kong/patches.yaml | \
    deck file add-tags \
      -o .github/artifacts/kong/flight-data-combined.yaml \
      "platform-repo-managed"
    
    # Create workspace configuration with sed
    sed "s/\${WORKSPACE}/$WORKSPACE/g" .github/artifacts/kong/workspace-template.yaml > .github/artifacts/kong/workspace-header.yaml
    
    # Combine the header with the configuration
    cat .github/artifacts/kong/workspace-header.yaml .github/artifacts/kong/flight-data-combined.yaml > platform/kong/.generated/workspaces/$WORKSPACE.yaml

# Sales team workspace
- name: Combine Sales Kong Configurations with Platform
  env:
    WORKSPACE: sales
  run: |
    # Generate the main configuration
    deck file merge \
      .github/artifacts/kong/sales/*.yaml \
      .github/artifacts/kong/platform/platform-base.yaml | \
    deck file patch platform/kong/patches.yaml | \
    deck file add-tags \
      -o .github/artifacts/kong/sales-combined.yaml \
      "platform-repo-managed"
    
    # Create workspace configuration with sed
    sed "s/\${WORKSPACE}/$WORKSPACE/g" .github/artifacts/kong/workspace-template.yaml > .github/artifacts/kong/workspace-header.yaml
    
    # Combine the header with the configuration
    cat .github/artifacts/kong/workspace-header.yaml .github/artifacts/kong/sales-combined.yaml > platform/kong/.generated/workspaces/$WORKSPACE.yaml

# Experience team workspace
- name: Create Experience API Configurations with Platform
  env:
    WORKSPACE: experience
  run: |
    # Generate the main configuration
    deck file merge \
      experience/kong/experience-service.yaml \
      .github/artifacts/kong/platform/platform-base.yaml | \
    deck file patch platform/kong/patches.yaml | \
    deck file add-tags \
      -o .github/artifacts/kong/experience-combined.yaml \
      "platform-repo-managed"
    
    # Create workspace configuration with sed
    sed "s/\${WORKSPACE}/$WORKSPACE/g" .github/artifacts/kong/workspace-template.yaml > .github/artifacts/kong/workspace-header.yaml
    
    # Combine the header with the configuration
    cat .github/artifacts/kong/workspace-header.yaml .github/artifacts/kong/experience-combined.yaml > platform/kong/.generated/workspaces/$WORKSPACE.yaml
```

This approach:
1. Creates a template file with a `${WORKSPACE}` placeholder
2. Uses `sed` to replace the placeholder with the actual workspace name
3. Sets the workspace name as an environment variable for each step
4. Combines the processed header with the main configuration

The `sed` command `s/\${WORKSPACE}/$WORKSPACE/g` replaces all occurrences of the literal string `${WORKSPACE}` with the value of the `$WORKSPACE` environment variable.

---

use modify the stage-changes to use sed in place edit

---



Here's how to modify the workflow to use `sed` for in-place editing to add the `_workspace` field:

```yaml
# Flight-data team workspace
- name: Combine Flight-data Kong Configurations with Platform
  env:
    WORKSPACE: flight-data
  run: |
    deck file merge \
      .github/artifacts/kong/flight-data/*.yaml \
      .github/artifacts/kong/platform/platform-base.yaml | \
    deck file patch platform/kong/patches.yaml | \
    deck file add-tags \
      -o platform/kong/.generated/workspaces/$WORKSPACE.yaml \
      "platform-repo-managed"
    
    # Add _workspace field using sed in-place edit
    sed -i "1s/^/_workspace: $WORKSPACE\n/" platform/kong/.generated/workspaces/$WORKSPACE.yaml

# Sales team workspace
- name: Combine Sales Kong Configurations with Platform
  env:
    WORKSPACE: sales
  run: |
    deck file merge \
      .github/artifacts/kong/sales/*.yaml \
      .github/artifacts/kong/platform/platform-base.yaml | \
    deck file patch platform/kong/patches.yaml | \
    deck file add-tags \
      -o platform/kong/.generated/workspaces/$WORKSPACE.yaml \
      "platform-repo-managed"
    
    # Add _workspace field using sed in-place edit
    sed -i "1s/^/_workspace: $WORKSPACE\n/" platform/kong/.generated/workspaces/$WORKSPACE.yaml

# Experience team workspace
- name: Create Experience API Configurations with Platform
  env:
    WORKSPACE: experience
  run: |
    deck file merge \
      experience/kong/experience-service.yaml \
      .github/artifacts/kong/platform/platform-base.yaml | \
    deck file patch platform/kong/patches.yaml | \
    deck file add-tags \
      -o platform/kong/.generated/workspaces/$WORKSPACE.yaml \
      "platform-repo-managed"
    
    # Add _workspace field using sed in-place edit
    sed -i "1s/^/_workspace: $WORKSPACE\n/" platform/kong/.generated/workspaces/$WORKSPACE.yaml
```

This approach:
1. Sets the `WORKSPACE` environment variable for each step
2. Uses the variable in the output file path
3. Uses `sed -i` for in-place editing to add the `_workspace` field at the beginning of the file
4. The pattern `1s/^/_workspace: $WORKSPACE\n/` adds the line at the very beginning of the file

The `-i` flag tells `sed` to edit the file in place, without creating a backup file.

---

what does 1s mean

---



In the `sed` command `1s/^/_workspace: $WORKSPACE\n/`:

- `1` specifies that the substitution should only be applied to line 1 of the file
- `s` is the substitution command
- `/^/` is the pattern to match (the beginning of the line)
- `/_workspace: $WORKSPACE\n/` is the text to insert at the matched position
- The result is adding `_workspace: flight-data` (or whatever the value of $WORKSPACE is) followed by a newline at the beginning of the file

So `1s` means "substitute at line 1". This ensures the `_workspace` field is added only at the beginning of the file, not at the beginning of every line.

---

can we replace every ${WORKSPACE} to the env variable

---



To replace every occurrence of `${WORKSPACE}` with the value of the environment variable `$WORKSPACE` throughout the file, you can use `sed` with the global flag:

```yaml
- name: Combine Flight-data Kong Configurations with Platform
  env:
    WORKSPACE: flight-data
  run: |
    deck file merge \
      .github/artifacts/kong/flight-data/*.yaml \
      .github/artifacts/kong/platform/platform-base.yaml | \
    deck file patch platform/kong/patches.yaml | \
    deck file add-tags \
      -o platform/kong/.generated/workspaces/$WORKSPACE.yaml \
      "platform-repo-managed"
    
    # Add _workspace field at the beginning
    sed -i "1s/^/_workspace: $WORKSPACE\n/" platform/kong/.generated/workspaces/$WORKSPACE.yaml
    
    # Replace all ${WORKSPACE} occurrences with the actual value
    sed -i "s/\${WORKSPACE}/$WORKSPACE/g" platform/kong/.generated/workspaces/$WORKSPACE.yaml
```

The key differences are:

1. The command `sed -i "s/\${WORKSPACE}/$WORKSPACE/g" ...` will:
   - Replace all occurrences of the literal string `${WORKSPACE}` with the value of the environment variable `$WORKSPACE`
   - The `g` flag at the end means "global" - replace all occurrences in each line, not just the first one
   - The backslash before `$` in `\${WORKSPACE}` escapes the `$` character so it's treated as a literal part of the search string

2. We keep the first `sed` command to add the `_workspace` field at the beginning of the file, and add a second `sed` command to replace any `${WORKSPACE}` placeholders in the content.

Apply this pattern to all three workspace sections (flight-data, sales, and experience).

Run deck file validate platform/kong/.generated/workspaces/$WORKSPACE.yaml
Error: building state: _plugin_config &quot;default-jwt&quot; not found
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.

---



The error indicates that a plugin configuration named "default-jwt" is referenced but not found. You need to add this plugin configuration to your platform base configuration. Here's how to fix it:

```yaml
# Generate platform base configuration
- name: Generate Platform Base Configuration
  run: |
    # Create a file with the missing plugin config
    cat > .github/artifacts/kong/platform/plugin-configs.yaml << EOF
_format_version: "3.0"
_plugin_configs:
  default-jwt:
    config:
      claims_to_verify:
        - exp
      key_claim_name: kid
      secret_is_base64: false
EOF
    
    # Merge all configurations including the plugin configs
    deck file merge \
      platform/kong/platform-kong-base.yaml \
      .github/artifacts/kong/platform/plugin-configs.yaml \
      platform/kong/plugins/* \
      platform/kong/vaults/* \
      -o .github/artifacts/kong/platform/platform-base.yaml
```

This creates a file with the missing plugin configuration and includes it in the merge. The plugin configuration defines a "default-jwt" configuration that can be referenced by JWT plugins in your services.

Alternatively, if you want to skip validation for now, you can modify the validation steps to continue even if there are errors:

```yaml
- name: Validate and Lint Flight-data Configuration
  env:
    WORKSPACE: flight-data
  run: |
    deck file validate platform/kong/.generated/workspaces/$WORKSPACE.yaml || true
    deck file lint -s platform/kong/.generated/workspaces/$WORKSPACE.yaml platform/kong/ruleset.yaml || true
```

The `|| true` ensures the step doesn't fail even if the command returns an error.

Generate a lucid chart for the example github action workflow

I can't directly generate a Lucid Chart, but I can provide you with a text-based diagram that you can use as a reference to create one in Lucid Chart. Here's a flowchart representation of the GitHub Actions workflow:

```

When creating your Lucid Chart:

1. Start with the trigger event (Push)
2. Add the "has-changes" job that detects file changes
3. Add the "oas-to-kong" job with its steps:
   - Platform base configuration generation
   - Parallel processing for each workspace (flight-data, sales, experience)
   - For each workspace, show the conversion, merging, and validation steps
   - Show the artifact upload and PR creation steps

You can use different shapes to represent different types of steps (e.g., rectangles for jobs, rounded rectangles for steps, diamonds for decision points) and arrows to show the flow between them.
